# Attrition

The objective of this project is to analyse the performance of different ML models for
employee attrition data and then use XAI(SHAP) to explain the model predictions with local as well as global interpretability.
The detailed objectives are:

• To identify the most suitable ML algorithm/ensemble method for the development of an
employee attrition model (based on factors like accuracy, precision, AUC, recall, F1 score
etc.)

• To explain the contribution of different features leading to employee turnover using XAI (eXplainable AI) like SHAP through the usage of summary plot, dependence
plot, individual force plot and collective force plot rendering the prediction model local as well as global interpretability.
